### script filter company &employee rows - 01.10 & 01.11
after the combination key command, you may need a pause / wait icon before the type variable command because it's too fast and it will confuse rpa.

### script process the company name excel - 01.03
if go variable function, which does not select the equal variable variable, its contents are still empty so the script does not run anything
I don't know if my script is corrupted but in mine it's still empty, usually if go it's filled with the initial variable equal empty and go to step at the end

### script open company & open employee - 01.01 and 01.02
I feel that in the wait icon section too many objects are cropped for this case, maybe there are some cases that require cropping a lot of icons but for this case I think one is enough

### script filter leave - 01.06
after the combination key command, it needs to pause for a few seconds afterwards

### Filtering unpaid leave - 02.00
empty command on if else function

###  unpaid leave available - 02.02
if go variable empty

if no icon go = truncated icon
