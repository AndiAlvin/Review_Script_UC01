### Script
I think the script for image ocr until train label is separated and made sub rpa again

I like how to find the cell address with the wait icon and press key ctrl + home, but another option is to use the click function and call the variable

the drawback is that where there is a sub rpa whose contents are empty there is only a command to pause

no mgt errors and import variables were found
